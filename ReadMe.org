* Reddit User Image Scraper

Use this awesome Python 2 or 3 script to download
- Images
- Gifs
- Imgur Albums
- Comments

...which you've marked as Liked, Hearted, or Saved from

- Reddit
- Tumblr

...to disk!

** Directions

*** 1. Install python dependencies

The following dependencies are required:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install praw pytumblr ImgurPython jsonpickle tornado
#+END_SRC

You'll want to use Python 3, which for your environment may require you to specify ~pip3~ instead of just ~pip~.

*** 2. Generate SSL keys

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir certificates
cd certificates
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout certificates/server_jupyter_based.crt.key -out certificates/server_jupyter_based.crt.pem
#+END_SRC

This step is only required if you want to use SSL, which ensures you have an encrypted connection to the server. You can disable this by opening ~LikedSavedDownloaderServer.py~ and setting ~useSSL=False~.

*** 3. Run the server

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd redditLikedSavedImageDownloader
python3 LikedSavedDownloaderServer.py
#+END_SRC

*** 4. Enter your account details and download the images

1. Open [[https://localhost:8888][localhost:8888]] in any web browser

If your web browser complains about the certificate, you may have to click ~Advanced~ and add the certificate as trustworthy, because you've signed the certificate and trust yourself :). If you want to get rid of this, you'll need to get a signing authority like ~LetsEncrypt~ to generate your certificate.

2. Use the Web Server Interface to configure the script:

3. Go to the Run Script page and click "Run Script"

4. Wait until the script finishes (it will say "Finished" at the bottom of the page)

5. Enjoy! Use Random Image Browser to jump to random images you've downloaded, or browse your output directory

**  Web Server Features

This repository includes a simple web server interface. Unlike the main script, the server is supported in Python 3 only.

To use it, install tornado via ~pip3 install tornado~ then run ~python3 LikedSavedDownloaderServer.py~. The interface can be seen by visiting ~https://localhost:8888~ in any web browser.

*The web server is not secure in any way and should NOT be run on an insecure network!*

** Running the script only

1. Open ~settings.txt~
2. Fill in your username and password
3. Set ~SHOULD_SOFT_RETRIEVE~ to ~False~ if you are sure you want to do this
4. Run the script: ~python redditUserImageScraper.py~
5. Wait for a while
6. Check your output directory (the default is ~output~ relative to where you ran the script) for all your images!

If you want more images, set ~Reddit_Total_Requests~ and/or ~Tumblr_Total_Requests~ to a higher value. The maximum is 1000. Unfortunately, reddit does not allow you to get more than 1000 submissions of a single type (1000 liked, 1000 saved).

Not actually getting images downloaded, but seeing the console say it downloaded images? Make sure ~SHOULD_SOFT_RETRIEVE=False~ in ~settings.txt~

~settings.txt~ has several additional features. Read the comments to know how to use them.
