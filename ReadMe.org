** Directions
*** 0. Check Releases
Check the [[https://github.com/makuto/Liked-Saved-Image-Downloader/releases][Releases]] page for a ready-to-use version of Content Collector. If you find a release for your system that works, you can skip straight to the *Usage* section.
*** 1. Clone this repository

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/makuto/Liked-Saved-Image-Downloader
#+END_SRC

*** 2. Install python dependencies

The following dependencies are required:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install praw pytumblr ImgurPython jsonpickle tornado youtube-dl git+https://github.com/ankeshanand/py-gfycat@master git+https://github.com/upbit/pixivpy py3-pinterest
#+END_SRC

You'll want to use Python 3, which for your environment may require you to specify ~pip3~ instead of just ~pip~.

**** Login-Protected Server

If you want to require the user to login before they can interact with the server, you must install passlib:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install passlib bcrypt argon2_cffi
#+END_SRC

*** 3. Generate SSL keys

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd Liked-Saved-Image-Downloader/
./Generate_Certificates.sh
#+END_SRC

This step is only required if you want to use SSL, which ensures you have an encrypted connection to the server. You can disable this by opening ~LikedSavedDownloaderServer.py~ and setting ~useSSL = False~.

*** 4. Run the server

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python3 LikedSavedDownloaderServer.py
#+END_SRC

** Usage
*** Access the server
Open [[https://localhost:8888][localhost:8888]] in any web browser.

If your web browser complains about the certificate, you may have to click ~Advanced~ and add the certificate as trustworthy, because you've signed the certificate and trust yourself :). 

/(Explanation: this certificate isn't trusted by your browser because you created it. It will still protect your traffic from people snooping on your LAN)./

If you want to get rid of this, you'll need to get a signing authority like ~LetsEncrypt~ to generate your certificate, and host the server under a proper domain.
*** Set password
When first running the server, you will be prompted to set a password.

/If you forget your password, simply delete passwords.txt/.

*** Home page

The home page provides access to all server features:

[[file:images/Homepage.png]]

*** Set up accounts

Use Settings to configure the script:

[[file:images/LikedSavedSettings.png]]

*Make sure to click "Save Settings" before closing the page.*

You don't have to fill in every field, only the accounts you want.

*** Download content
Go to the Download Content page and click "Download new content":

[[file:images/DownloadContent.png]]

Wait until the downloader finishes (it will say "Finished" at the bottom of the page). While the downloader is running, the "Download new content" button will disappear.

*** Browse content
Enjoy! Use Browse Content to jump to random content you've downloaded, or browse your output directory:

[[file:images/LikedSavedBrowser.png]]

The browser should scale nicely to work on both mobile and desktop.

** Login management

The script requires login before running the script, changing settings, or browsing downloaded content.

If you host Content Collector on the internet, you should rely on a more robust authentication scheme (e.g. use a reverse proxy which won't proxy requests to Content Collector until you have authenticated with the proxy server). Content Collector was designed for LAN use.

Note that all login cookies will be invalidated each time you restart the server. If you don't restart the server, your browser should remember login indefinitely.

*** Managing passwords(s)

The web interface will automatically prompt for a new password when first starting up.

You can also use ~PasswordManager.py~ to generate a file ~passwords.txt~ with your hashed (and salted) passwords:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python3 PasswordManager.py "Your Password Here"
#+END_SRC

You can create multiple valid passwords, if desired. There are no separate accounts, however.

If you want to reset all passwords, simply delete ~passwords.txt~.

*** Disabling Login

Open ~LikedSavedDownloaderServer.py~ and find ~enable_authentication~. Set it equal to ~False~. You must restart the server for this to take effect.
** Running the script only

*This is deprecated.* You should use the web server to configure and run the script instead.

1. Copy ~settings_template.txt~ into a new file called ~settings.txt~
2. Open ~settings.txt~
3. Fill in your username and password
4. Set ~SHOULD_SOFT_RETRIEVE~ to ~False~ if you are sure you want to do this
5. Run the script: ~python redditUserImageScraper.py~
6. Wait for a while
7. Check your output directory (the default is ~output~ relative to where you ran the script) for all your images!

If you want more images, set ~Reddit_Total_Requests~ and/or ~Tumblr_Total_Requests~ to a higher value. The maximum is 1000. Unfortunately, reddit does not allow you to get more than 1000 submissions of a single type (1000 liked, 1000 saved).

Not actually getting images downloaded, but seeing the console say it downloaded images? Make sure ~SHOULD_SOFT_RETRIEVE=False~ in ~settings.txt~

~settings.txt~ has several additional features. Read the comments to know how to use them.

** OSX Python issues
On OSX, running the downloader from the Content Collector server may cause this error:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
Output: output
objc[29889]: +[__NSPlaceholderDate initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called.
#+END_SRC

This is a problem with Python and OSX's security model clashing. See [[https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/32499][this issue]] for an explanation.

To work around it, you need to first run

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES
#+END_SRC

...before running the Content Collector server in that same terminal.

Or add the bash profile suggested in [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50168647/multiprocessing-causes-python-to-crash-and-gives-an-error-may-have-been-in-progr][this answer]].
